When Swift throws an error it's often useful to capture a backtrace at the point of the throw (not at the point it results in an unexpected error).

This library intercepts calls to swift_willThrow to capture a backtrace during the throw and if an unexpected error actually occurs then the backtrace is printed to stdout.


MacOS
=====
1. Run the build.sh script

2. Run your app as normal but set/export the environment variable:

    DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=<path to libswiftinterpose-macosx.dylib>

You can edit the Xcode scheme to set this or add it your command line:

DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=<path to libswiftinterpose.dylib> my_program

There may be other ways to make this work, the iOS usage probably works as well


iOS
===
1. Add interpose.c to a framework (it must be a framework/dylib).


Linux
=====
Not yet.
